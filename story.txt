In a land far away, called Paradise Hills there is a man named Spartacus.

He is been described as one "who, from a Thracian mercenary, had become a
 Roman soldier, that had deserted and became enslaved, and afterward,
from consideration of his strength, a gladiator" by Florus. 


He has a trusted ally, named Bob. Bob was sloppy, powerless and strength-wise furthest from the 
almighty Spartacus. However, he had a good heart, and was willing to lend a helping hand anytime, 
which is why Spartacus believed that Bob will one day be recognized as a hero by everyone.
