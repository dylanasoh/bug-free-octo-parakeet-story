In a land far away, called Paradise Hills there is a man named Spartacus.

He is been described as one "who, from a Thracian mercenary, had become a
 Roman soldier, that had deserted and became enslaved, and afterward,
from consideration of his strength, a gladiator" by Florus. 


He has a trusted ally, named Bob. Bob was sloppy, powerless and strength-wise furthest from the 
almighty Spartacus. However, he had a good heart, and was willing to lend a helping hand anytime, 
which is why Spartacus believed that Bob will one day be recognized as a hero by everyone. 
-Adrian Tse

This belief of Spartacus in Bob showed not only his physical strength, but al
so his mental kind power. This is what Spartacus was famous for.

Bob nominated Spartacus to become king of Paradise Hills. Spartacus accepted hisnomination and went on to become one of the greatest kings of Paradise Hills in history.
